Introduction

Mechanoid is an Eclipse Plugin sporting a set of code generators for Androidâ„¢ 
driven by DSL's (Domain Specific Languages) with full Eclipse Editor Support 
for the rapid development of Android applications.

Code Generators
---------------
Mechanoid is currently composed of four generators, each code generator focuses
on specific components of an Android application.

syntax highlighting, content assist and validation thanks to the powerful 
xText Language Framwork.
