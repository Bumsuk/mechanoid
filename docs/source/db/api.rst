The Mechanoid DB API
====================
This topic describes how to work with your database which you define in
a ``mechdb`` file, such as how to insert, update, and bind data using  the Android
Adapter API, and CursorLoader API.

When we discuss the Mechanoid DB API, it includes both the base API provided in 
the ``com.robotoworks.mechanoid.db`` package of the *Mechanoid Library Jar*, as 
well as the generated Content Provider API from your Mechanoid DB database 
definitions.

The running example is the Recipes Example, which is an example project
provided in the Mechanoid Source on github, it is useful to refer to this
example to get a full picture of the generated API.
